## Write-up

I started by identifying the historical incident mentioned in the challenge. Searching for an 1810 London hoax quickly led me to the well-documented **Berners Street Hoax**, a large-scale prank in which deliveries, tradesmen, and even officials were deliberately redirected to a single residence in London, creating widespread confusion.

Once the hoax was identified, the next step was to determine who was responsible for it. Historical sources consistently attribute the prank to **Theodore Edward Hook**, a writer and humorist known for elaborate practical jokes.

The challenge stated that the culprit later confessed to the hoax in a *semi-autobiographical novel*. With this clue, I researched Hook’s literary works, focusing specifically on novels that drew from his own life. This led me to **_Gilbert Gurney_**, a semi-autobiographical novel in which Hook fictionalizes events from his personal experiences and indirectly acknowledges his role in the Berners Street Hoax.

By identifying the correct novel and applying the required flag format, I was able to construct the final answer.
