## Write-up

When I started this challenge, only two artifacts were available: a diary and a photograph. Since the category was OSINT, I knew the solution would rely on real-world investigation rather than technical exploitation.

I began by carefully examining the photograph. The surroundings, especially the tree and the structure near it, appeared distinctive. Using reverse image searching and location-based OSINT techniques, I was able to trace the image back to **Bhopal, India**.

Next, I analyzed the diary. The writer repeatedly mentioned obeying a *voice* that no one else could hear. This suggested psychological influence tied to a real person or historical event rather than anything supernatural. With the location narrowed down, I searched for documented incidents and public records related to the area shown in the photograph.

By correlating news articles, archived reports, and other open-source references, I identified a tragic real-world case connected to the location. Multiple sources pointed toward **Bhopal Singh** as the origin of the voice influencing the writer.

Combining the contextual clues from the diary with the photographic evidence allowed me to confidently identify the source of the mysterious voice.
